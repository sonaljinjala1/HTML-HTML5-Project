				<p><b>In the late 1960s </b>the garage assumed operation of <i>the Red Arrow routes with MBAs and later LSs until its closure in 1985.</i> Following the closure of the Victoria and Ash Grove garages, from 1987 Walworth operated <u>the Red Arrow routes for a short time until the Waterloo garage was ready.</u>

				<b>During the early 1990s the garage once again re-opened, this time for the Londonlinks operation of routes 78 and 176. The Cowie Group undertook a major restructure a few years later which once again saw closure of Walworth garage in 1997.</b> The garage was owned by the Go-Ahead Group and they leased it out.

				<i>The garage lay dormant for the next six years until late 2003 when work started on refurbishing the garage for Travel London, </i>who needed more garage space after some contract wins including routes 381, 452 and N381.

				<u>Travel London won the contract for route 407, starting from 31<sup>th</sup> October 2009.</u> This was used as the launch of the new Abellio name.</p>

				<strong>The City of London, </strong>widely referred to <i>simply as the City, is a city, ceremonial county and local government district[note 1] that contains the ancient centre, and constitutes, alongside Canary Wharf, the primary central business district (CBD) of London and one of the leading financial centres of the world.</i> It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1<sup>st</sup> century AD to the Middle Ages, but the modern area referred to as London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary. The City is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London, though it remains a notable part of central London. <u>Administratively, the City of London is not one of the London boroughs, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including Greater London's only other city, the City of Westminster).</u> <i>It is also a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by Greater London, and is the smallest ceremonial county in England.</i>
